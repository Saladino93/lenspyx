Welcome to lenspyx's documentation!
===================================

   Curved-sky python lensed CMB maps simulation package by Julien Carron.

   This allows one to build very easily (if familiar with healpy) lensed CMB simulations. Parallelization is done with openmp.
   The numerical cost is approximately that of an high-res harmonic transform.
