Welcome to lenspyx's documentation!
===================================

   Curved-sky python lensed CMB maps simulation package.

   This allows one to build very easily lensed CMB simulations, and contains other tools for CMB lensing reconstruction.

   Lenspyx now essentially only wraps extremely efficient routines from DUCC by M.Reinecke. See `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10431)>`_.
